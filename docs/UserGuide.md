### 3.1. Add a new internship application: `add`

Adds a new internship application to your tracker. This allows you to log the essential details—Company and Role—and optionally record the application deadline immediately so you never miss a closing date.

Format: `add c/COMPANY r/ROLE [d/DEADLINE] [ct/CONTACT]`

* c/COMPANY: The name of the company (e.g., Google, Meta).
* r/ROLE: The position applied for (e.g., Software Engineer).
* d/DEADLINE: (Optional) The closing date for the application or next task.
    * Format: YYYY-MM-DD
* ct/CONTACT: (Optional) The HR contact/primary recruiter contact for this application.

Examples:
* `add c/Google r/Software Engineer`
    * Adds an application for Google as a Software Engineer with default status Pending.
* `add c/Shopee r/Backend Intern d/2023-11-30 ct/Johns`
    * Adds an application with a specific deadline and through Johns.

### 3.2. Filter applications by status: `filter`

Filters applications by their status and lists them.

Format: `filter s/STATUS`

* s/STATUS: The status to filter by (case-insensitive).

Examples:
* `filter s/Pending`
    * Lists all applications with status "Pending".
* `filter s/Rejected`
    * Lists all applications with status "Rejected".
