## Introduction

InternTrack is a command-line application that helps users track their internship applications efficiently. It allows users to record application details, update statuses, and organize applications using filtering and sorting commands.

InternTrack is designed for students who prefer fast keyboard-based workflows.

---

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have **Java 17 or above** installed.
2. Download the latest version of `InternTrack` from  
   https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2113-W10-1/tp/releases/tag/v1.0
3. Open a terminal in the folder containing the jar file.
4. Run the application using:
```
java -jar InternTrack.jar
```
5. Type commands into the terminal and press Enter to execute them.

## Features

### Notes about the command format

* Words in **UPPER_CASE** are parameters to be supplied by the user. Example: `add c/COMPANY` where COMPANY is replaced by the user.
* Items in **square brackets** are optional. Example: `[d/DEADLINE]`
* Parameters can be given in **any order**. Example: `add c/Google r/Intern` is the same as `add r/Intern c/Google`.

# FAQ

**Q: Can I undo multiple actions?**  
Yes. InternTrack keeps a history of previous states, so multiple undo commands can be used sequentially.

Undo history is cleared when the application restarts.
